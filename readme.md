## Challenges 


I ran to a couple challeneges as making the background fit for different web browser devices.


Also ran into trounle trying to make the "play again" button to work but this youtube video was really helpful on that quick and to the point. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azl6WzYuvgM&t=94s


I tried to make animations happen with jquery and was having difficulties as well so I ended doing "@key fade" in the css and made the questions pop in when the page loads. I did want to make it fade in everytime you choose an answer but sadly I couldn't figure it out even after all the research I did.
